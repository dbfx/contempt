contempt Wordpress Theme
========

The Contempt Wordpress theme, originally made my be 5+ years ago. It's had some updates, some work, but needs lots of work. I've made it public as the old locations have been long since lost.

This was made partially famous by it's inclusion in the first round of WordPress.com themes. I haven't actively worked on WordPress in a long time and don't know the situation now (although I'm still a WordPress user of course!)

This is what was known as v2 of the theme, which was an update from some time ago. 

Feel free to use the theme, to improve the theme, and to enjoy the theme.
